				<h3>About Me</h3>
                            I have not eaten meat since 2017, as I try to live a holistic lifestyle, and I am concious
							 of the things I consume in all aspects. My favorite beverages I consume the most are 
							 water and tea - but I have taken an interest in black coffee recently. I have a passion for food,
							 and I love to explore different cultures while discovering new dishes. Aside from academics, my 
							 activities of interests are hanging with my friends, playing sports - as I am 
							 highly competitive, cooking, and teaching/tutoring others, amongst other activities. I am active,
							 running, riding my bike frequently, and doing '50'; or sets of pushups throughout the day.
							 The knowledge I have obtained comes from a vast variety of information such as: 
							 Quora Digest, Youtube, Google, classrooms and books, and listening to people.
							
							<br>
							<br>
				
							I am currently working on several endeavors, running short sprints to see what works. I will be updating this 
							website with photos from traveling, food, and various entreprenurial ventures I undertake. 
				
				 			<br>
							<br>
							 
							  My mother (pictured above) is my inspiration, as she has continuously made the best 
							 out of less than optimal circumstances.
