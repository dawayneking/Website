									<h3>Interests</h3>
								After completing multiple internships, research experiences, and exploring 
								a plethora of opportunities, I've realized I have a multifacited array of 
								interests. From my major and discpline, I have found an interest in mechanical 
								engineering, design, and analytical/systensis related work. I have also started 
								learning concepts related to Computer Vision, Machine Learning, dive deeper in depth 
								of coding; and a plethora of other topics I discovered as interesting. 
								
								<br>
								<br>

                                I am interested in all of the STEM and Engineering Sciences; but I love to learn new 
								subject areas as well. I have a passion for learning, and helping 
								 others through the work that I do through service or my skillsets. Currently
								I am working on a personal ML project to predict rapid eye movement for usage 
								on mobile devices such as phones, tablets, etc... The idea would be to use CV
								to keep track of readers blink rate, propose eye detection and tracking algorithm
								designed to keep track of eyes, and predict eye position in the camera framework using
								feedback from built in accelerometer. I've started to 
								 explore around the world. 2018 was the first time I've taken an airplane, and I went 
								 to my first NASA internship in DC at Headquarters. In less than three years I 
								 went from only living in Florida and visiting Georgia a few times, to
								  visiting: Alabama, Virginia, New York, Washington DC, Maryland, North 
								  Carolina, South Carolina, Utah, Idaho, Washington State, and Wyoming. I aspire to explore
								  as much as possible.

				<h3>About Me</h3>
                            I have not eaten meat since 2017, as I try to live a holistic lifestyle, and I am concious
							 of the things I consume in all aspects. My favorite beverages I consume the most are 
							 water and tea - but I have taken an interest in black coffee recently. I have a passion for food,
							 and I love to explore different cultures while discovering new dishes. Aside from academics, my 
							 activities of interests are hanging with my friends, playing sports - as I am 
							 highly competitive, cooking, and teaching/tutoring others, amongst other activities. I am active,
							 running, riding my bike frequently, and doing '50'; or sets of pushups throughout the day.
							 The knowledge I have obtained comes from a vast variety of information such as: 
							 Quora Digest, Youtube, Google, classrooms and books, and listening to people.
							
							<br>
							<br>
				
							I am currently working on several endeavors, running short sprints to see what works. I will be updating this 
							website with photos from traveling, food, and various entreprenurial ventures I undertake. 
				
				 			<br>
							<br>
							 
							  My mother (pictured above) is my inspiration, as she has continuously made the best 
							 out of less than optimal circumstances.
