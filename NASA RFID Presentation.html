                            Objective:</font></b>
            <br>Conduct research on Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID), and capabilities to track electronic equipment. Intended purpose would be to locate any given asset within NASA HQ, and verify correct presence. As a verification precacaution, Quick Response (QR) Codes would additionally be used to verify location presence manually.

            <b>Outline:</b>
            <br>
            This document will serve as an outline and plan for all information regarding The Inventory and Asset Management Project – RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Technology. With this information, you will get familiar with the information regarding RFID Technology, an idea about the software and hardware services other vendors may provide, and a general overview of the process of implementing this technology in NASA’s environment. For detailed information, or steps regarding the overall project, you may review an inserted document of the tactical plan and instructional document. Information within the document will show a current amount of information up to a certain date, via draft, and the timeline for the process to inventory all items. You may review all teams, and the duties that each skill set position requires. The document will walk you from the initial vetting phase, display information about the verification process, and lastly the exception steps. Additionally, the team’s responsibilities and overview each team will be provided within the previously mentioned document. For other informational components, you may access the Strategic Plan regarding the Physical Independent Verification and Validation of ACES IT Assets. This document will go in depth regarding the information and outline all the components within the portion of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Technology) Technology. The second component of this document will speak on the QR (2D Code) capabilities as a failsafe for the RFID Technology. Upon implementing all perspective components in the RFID initial phase, an additional component that will be effortlessly created are 2D codes, which can be assigned individual upon assigning RFID. After looking over the recommended documents mentioned above, you will have a full understanding and concept regarding the overall mission of the project. For more in depth information regarding the projects components such as vendors, software, and hardware you may continue to the binder of information.

            <b>Problems:</b>
            <br>
            Various obstacles were encountered when visioning potential ideas, such as: 
            <br>
            Requires seperate server from NASA HQ
            <br>
            Need to be easily accessible, user friendly, and capable of carrying out goal of project (asset management - inventory)
            <br>
            Completely private from provider, and secure for NASA usage
            <br>
