            <b>Overview:</b>
            <br>
             Above, you will find the duties that I have done for each supervisor throughout the summer of 2018. I worked with the Sumter County Board of County Commissioners in Sumter County, Florida. With this internship, I was able to work as a cross displinary Civil Engineer and Mechanical Engineer.

            <b>Overview: Eslie Oxendine - County Inspector</b>
            <br>
            With the County Inspector, Eslie Oxendine, I was tasked with assisting inspections - and following up with technical reports. Additional work in the field included intersection site distance evaluations, and surveying land.  With newer software implemented weeks before my arrival, I additionally had the ability to learn and create several Standard Operating Procedures for supervisors to navigate easily.

            <b>Overview: Blair Bean - Assistant Public Works Director</b>
            <br>
            With Sumter County's Assistant Public Works Director, I was tasked with a plethora of direct contact with contractors and the Florida Department of Transportation - District five (5). Project meetings included the preconstruction for County road 475 (C-475), various stormwater/pipe repair preconstruction projects, invitations to bid, and meetings regarding Battlefield Parkway to monitor progress. Additionally, a major project I had the opportunity to lead was the 10 year Pavement Management Program Assessment.
